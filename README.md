# LunchTimeRoudna

At work we wanted some app which tell us where to go to lunch. After some time I wanted to try node.js and so I opened editor and started to write this web app.

## If you want to help…

### …as feature creator

Just create new issue at GitHub or send me e-mail to horejsekmichal [at] gmail.com.

### …as developer

Firstly you have to install some dependencies. Just run following command or open `Makefile` and do it by hand:

    make install-dependencies

Then you can start node.js server with this command:

    make run

That's all! Now you can help me to add some cool features. ;-) But remember: it has to be for user easy to use, clean and quick to load.

## Fork

If you want, you can fork it and create your own lunchtime for another area.

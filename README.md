## LunchTimeAndÄ›l

At work we wanted some app which tell us where to go to lunch. After some time I wanted to try node.js and so I opened editor and started write this web app.

# If you want to help (as feature creator)

Just create new issue at GitHub or send me e-mail to horejsekmichal [at] gmail.com.

# If you want to help (as developer)

Firstly you have to install some dependencies. Just run:

    make localdev

Then you can already start node.js server with this command:

    make run

That's all! Now you can help me to add some cool features. ;) But remember: it have to be stay for user easy to use, clean and quick to load.

# Fork

If you want, you can fork it and create your own lunchtime for another area.
